## Hey there :wave:

This organization is the home for mostly internal projects but also some hopefully soon coming public projects :blush:

### :pushpin: How to contribute (only members)

- In case of creating a new repo use a short but meaningful name, written lowercase and with dashes between words like `my-perfect-repo`
- Files and folders should also been written lowercase and using dashes instead of whitespaces. Avoid excessive use of prefixes :wink:
- Use unique code style within single repositories. Better would be a unique code style accross the whole organization

## Hey there :wave:

This organization is the home for mostly internal CSOC projects but also some hopefully soon coming public content :blush:

### :pushpin: How to contribute (only members)

#### Creating repos

- In case of creating a new repo please use a short but meaningful name, written lowercase and with dashes between words like `my-perfect-repo`
- Files and folders should also been written lowercase and using dashes instead of whitespaces. Avoid excessive use of prefixes :wink:
- Use unique code style within single repositories

#### Committing code

- Please do not commit unfinished code to the main branch. :no_entry_sign: Use your own branch instead and create a pull request when finished
- Write short and meaningful commits. Stick to valid spelling :notebook: as well as upper and lower case letters! [Wait, what??! :angry:](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/?utm_source=pocket_mylist)
